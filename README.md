## Description
NOVELty book swap is a full-stack application that lets User securely signup and login to create their own digital library to share with other members. Users can search the books they have at home by ISBN and add to their personal library, ready to share. Once User has created an account and added some books, they are able to see other members' books on the Browse page. Features include requesting to borrow a book, deleting books from your library, User managed check-out of their personal library, and of course tracking of your owned and borrowed books from your NOVELty library!
